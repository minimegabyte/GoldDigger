#### Game Objective
To search and collect as much gold as possible!

#### Game Play
To collect gold, your mouse pointer is the torchlight and you will search for a randomly position piece of gold displayed on the game board. But be careful, you only have a short time before that piece of gold changes it's location...If you aren't quick enough and click anywhere that is not gold, you lose!
