# User Stories

## As a user, I want
- to see a menu that lets me put in my name.

- to see my score displayed on a scoreboard as I play
- my name to show on a leaderboard, if I get a high score.

## As a developer, I want 
- to show tiles.
- to show one tile that will light up at a time
- the user to be able to click on that tile
- the user to get a point if they can click on that lit up tile
- to show the points they earned in a score box.
- to show the gold in a different spot on the canvas after the user has clicked on it
- the game to end under these conditions:
- (LOSE) the user cannot click on a tile fast enough
- the user to be taken back to the main menu
- show the playerâ€™s name and score on a leaderboard
	- If the same person plays again and they get another high score, they will have another entry
